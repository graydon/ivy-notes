      <div id="content"><p>This is a set of notes made in an attempt to organize my reading of, and thinking about, the documentation provided with the <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/ivy/">Ivy</a> tool.</p>

<p>Ivy's existing docs are good, but have some shortcomings: they're incomplete (much is only covered in testcases, examples, or comments inside the implementation); they have a fixed tutorial-centric presentation order for many concepts; they assume a lot of background knowledge in formal logic; and they lack navigational structure (especially internal hyperlinking) which helps learn a concept that depends on several others one is learning simultaneously.</p>

<p>All this makes it a bit hard (or did for me) to learn the full scope of material presented. So I started making these notes to help myself out.</p>

<p>My goals here are threefold:</p>

<ul>
<li>To <strong>decompose</strong> the existing documentation into lots of inter-linked concept-specific notes, to allow the reader to explore in any order they need to, iteratively, and starting from any point they wish.</li>
<li>To <strong>consolidate</strong> all the various facts mentioned or implied about each concept throughout multiple tutorials, test cases, papers and the existing reference into each concept-specific page.</li>
<li>To <strong>expand</strong> on each concept beyond how it's covered in the existing documentation, through linking to external papers, conducting experiments with the tool and recording the results as examples, and writing original text/explanations myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that my doing this work is not viewed as a disapproval of the existing tutorials -- they are good for what they do, exploring a conceptual landscape and the intended organization and development of an Ivy project. But I've found them inadequate for my learning task, and Ivy is just conceptually quite big and complex! I think good documentation requires multiple perspectives and organizations, which I hope to help provide.</p>

<p>Source material for this is a mix of the existing Ivy docs (which are all MIT-licensed), my own writing (which is MIT-licensed) and small excerpts from papers that have particularly lucid explanations (which I believe / hope fall under either liberal licensing regimes or the doctrine of fair use, though not all of them are clear).</p>

<p>Please let me know if you see words of yours that you don't think it's license-legitimate for me to be publishing here. Also any other feedback, bug fixes, corrections or patches welcome!</p>
