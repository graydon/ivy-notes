      <div id="content"><p>This is a set of notes made in an attempt to organize my reading of, and thinking about, the documentation provided with the <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/ivy/">IVy</a> tool.</p>

<p>IVy's existing documentation is organized <em>mostly</em> as a series of tutorials, each of which introduces some concepts (but not all) in some order (not necessarily the order you want) and assuming a great deal of background understanding of terms in formal logic, verification and distributed systems.</p>

<p>There are also a couple reference pages on the language and <a href="command.html">command</a> line, but the language reference page is quite incomplete and disorganized, hard to navigate or look up information on. Much of what one needs to know about each topic referenced is actually hidden somewhere in a tutorial.</p>

<p>Having attempted to read the tutorials "end to end" multiple times, and become frustrated, confused or unable to keep everything in my head at once, I've subsequently found it difficult to gain enough understanding of the tool's theory (and even legal forms of syntax) to be able to make progress when working on examples.</p>

<p>My goals here are threefold:</p>

<ul>
<li>To <strong>decompose</strong> the existing documentation into lots of inter-linked concept-specific notes, to allow the reader to explore in any order they need to, iteratively, and starting from any point they wish.</li>
<li>To <strong>consolidate</strong> all the various facts mentioned or implied about each concept throughout multiple tutorials and the existing reference into each concept-specific page.</li>
<li>To <strong>expand</strong> on each concept beyond how it's covered in the existing documentation, through linking to external papers, conducting experiments with the tool and recording the results as examples, and writing original text/explanations myself.</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope that my doing this work is not viewed as a disapproval of the existing tutorials -- they are good for what they do, exploring a conceptual landscape and the intended organization and development of an IVy project. But I find them inadequate for my task here, and IVy is just conceptually quite big and complex! I think good documentation requires multiple perspectives and organizations, which I hope to help provide.</p>

<p>Source material for this is a mix of the existing IVy docs (which are all MIT-licensed), my own writing (which is MIT-licensed) and small excerpts from papers that have particularly lucid explanations (which I believe / hope fall under either liberal licensing regimes or the doctrine of fair use, though not all of them are clear).</p>

<p>Please let me know if you see words of yours that you don't think it's license-legitimate for me to be publishing here. Also any other feedback or patches welcome!</p>
