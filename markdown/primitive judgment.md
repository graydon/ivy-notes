One of the following [[logical judgment]] (which are in turn kinds of [[declaration]]):

  - [[type]] declarations
  - [[function]], [[relation]], [[declared variable]] and [[individual]] declarations
  - [[primitive axiom|primitive axioms]]
  - [[property|properties]]
  - [[definition]]
  - [[theory instantiation]]
  - [[invariant|invariants]]

In a [[proof]], primitive axioms and properties are automatically applied by the default tactic unless they are qualified by the `explicit` keyword, in which case they must be expicitly [[judgment application|applied]] using the `apply` keyword, like [[schema|compound judgments]].
