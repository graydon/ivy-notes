[[keywords|keyword]]: `axiom`

A [[proposition]] whose truth is admitted by fiat.

Has two sub-forms:
  - [[primitive axiom|primitive axioms]]
  - [[axiom schema|axiom schemata]]

Axioms are admitted to the current context without [[proof]].

Axioms are dangerous, since they can introduce inconsistencies. You should use axioms only if you are developing a foundational theory and you know what you are doing, or to make a temporary assumption that will later be removed.
