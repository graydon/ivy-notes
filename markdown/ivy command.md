[[command|Command]]: `ivy`

This command runs an interactive user interface for constructing inductive [[invariant|invariants]]. The options are as follows:

`ui=interface`

Here, `interface` specifies the user interface for invariant construction. The values are:

  - `art` This interface supports interactive construct of an Abstract Reachability Tree.
  - `cti` This interface supports an interactive approach to invariant construction based on counterexamples to induction.

The default value is `art`.
