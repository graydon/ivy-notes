An IVy **program** is just an `.ivy` source file.

It corresponds to a single implicit top-level object, which can therefore be referred to as `this` from top-level declarations.

Any [[module]] or [[object]] [[declaration|declarations]] at the top level of a program introduce scopes for further [[declaration|declarations]] which can be referred to elsewhere by dot-separated qualified names.
