[[keywords|Keyword]]: `assert`

A [[statement]] that asserts that a given [[proposition]] is true.

Assertions are checked statically as part of checking an action. They are considered an internal part of the action's body rather than [[precondition]] and [[postcondition]] contracts that are made visible to the caller of the action.

The exact relationship between assertions, [[assumption|assumptions]], preconditions and postconditions is discussed on the [[weakest liberal precondition]] page.
