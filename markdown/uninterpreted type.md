A [[type]] is **uninterpreted** when it has not been given any [[theory instantiation|interpretation]] as a [[sort]] known to the underlying logic.

In other words: as far as the logic knows, an [[individual]] of that type **exists** but has no other properties than those the user declares.

Many types in IVy programs are uninterpreted.

Functions over uninterpreted types are called [[uninterpreted function|uninterpreted functions]]. Satisfiability of uninterpreted functions is decidable.
