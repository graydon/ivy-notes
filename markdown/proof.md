[[keywords|Keyword]]: `proof`

A proof is an optional sequence of [[tactic]] invocations that trails a [[logical judgment]] establshing its validity. Multiple tactic invocations must be separated by a semicolon (`;`) and the entire proof may be enclosed in curly braces (`{...}`)

If a proof is not supplied for a judgment, IVy's default [[tactic]] will attempt to prove validity automatically.
