State variables are all [[variable|variables]], [[relation|relations]] and [[function|functions]] that can be [[assignment|assigned]] (modified) in [[action|actions]].

If a [[relation]] or [[function]] is [[definition|defined]] then it is immutable and not a state variable. Attempting to [[assignment|assign]] to a defined variable produces an error.
