An [[module instantiation|instance]] of a [[module]].

If the module was separately declared using the `module` keyword, an object that is an instance of the module is declared with the `instance` keyword.

The combination of a module and its instantiation may also be abbreviated with the `object` keyword, which declares a [[singleton object]].

An [[isolate]] is a special kind of object that is verified in isolation from other objects (typically also using `specification` and `implementation` information-hiding blocks)
