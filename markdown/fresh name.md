A name is said to be "fresh" if it does not occur in any existing properties or definitions in the current context.

A [[freshness qualifier]] (keyword: `fresh`) can be added to premises in [[schema|compound judgments]] to require that the corresponding premise name supplied when [[judgment application|applying]] the judgment is fresh.
