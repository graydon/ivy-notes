In earlier versions of IVy, formulas and [[term|terms]] were different syntactic categories. As of IVy 1.7, the concepts have been combined into a single [[term]] grammar. "Formula" is now just synonymous with "term".

Both of these concepts are synonymous in IVy with [[expression|expressions]], and that's the page that has the actual definition.
