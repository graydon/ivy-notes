A [[formula]] is in **prenex normal form** if it is written as a string of ([[universal quantifier|universal]] or [[existential quantifier|existential]]) quantifiers and bound [[logical variable|logical variables]], called the **prefix**, followed by a quantifier-free part, called the **matrix**.

Every first-order logical formula can be written in prenex normal form.

Classification of formulas in prenex normal form often involves looking at the [[quantifier alternation]] structure of the prefix.
