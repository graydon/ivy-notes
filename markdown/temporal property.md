[[keywords|Keywords]]: `temporal`, `globally`, `eventually`

IVy has some support for [[property|properties]] in temporal logic. In this logic, the normal [[expression]] grammar is augmented with `globally <expr>` and `eventually <expr>`.

Temporal properties can be proven with the `tactic l2s` and `tactic invariance` [[tactic|tactics]].
