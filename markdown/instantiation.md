The word "instantiation" is used in Ivy to refer to several different things:

  - "schema instantiation" as a form of [[judgment application]] within a [[proof]]
  - [[explicit quantifier instantiation]] within a [[proof]]
  - [[module instantiation]] that [[declaration|declares]] an [[object]] within a [[module]]
  - [[theory instantiation]] that [[declaration|declares]] an interpretation of a [[type]] within a [[module]]
