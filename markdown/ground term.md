A ground term or (or gound formula, ground instance, etc.) is a term that does not contain any [[logical variable]].

This should not be confused with a term that does not contain [[state variable|state variables]].

Ground terms **may** and often do contain [[declared variable|declared variables]] and other [[state variable|state variables]] such as [[function]] symbols applied to other ground terms.

See the page on [[logical variable|logical variables]] for an example differentiating logical variables from various state variables and other ground terms.
