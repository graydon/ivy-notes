[[keywords|Keyword]]: `attribute`

An attribute declares some practical aspect of the way an [[object]] is treated by the various Ivy [[command|commands]]. Typically these relate to [[code extraction]].

Attributes may name a dot-separated [[object]] name prefix, in which case they apply only to the named object. If there is no prefix provided, they apply the object enclosing their [[declaration]].

The following attributes are currently supported:
  - `weight`: provides (as a double-quoted string) a floating-point weight between `"0"` and `"1"` that biases the execution of [[action|actions]] in an [[code extraction|extracted]] randomized tester (as generated by [[ivy_to_cpp command]])
  - `test`: provides the name of an object to generate tests for, in an [[code extraction|extracted]] randomized tester.
  - `method`: specifies the preferred method of verifying an isolate. Equivalent to passing the `method` option on the command-line to [[ivy_check command|ivy_check]].
  - `separate`: controls theory separation in model checking when using `method=mc`
  - `iterable`: instructs [[code extraction]] to iterate over values of an uninterpreted type `t` in generated code by calling functions `t.iter.create(int)`, `t.iter.is_end(int)`, and `t.iter.next(int)`. 
  - `cardinality`: instructs [[code extraction]] to calculate the cardinality of an uninterpreted type `t` in generated code by consulting variable `t.cardinality`, which should be an integer.
  - `radix`: controls the output formatting of trace messages in [[code extraction|extracted code]]. The only legal non-default value is `16`, which causes printing in hexadecimal.
  - `override`: specifies a sort to interpret an [[uninterpreted type]] as during [[code extraction]].
  - `cppstd`: specifies the C++ standard used in [[code extraction]], the only legal non-default action is the symbol `cpp11`
  - `libspec`: specifies a comma-separated list of libraries to link with the system linker when linking [[code extraction|extracted code]]
  - `macro_finder`: equivalent to passing the `macro_finder` option to [[ivy_check command|ivy_check]]

## Example:

```
object t = {
    attribute cardinality = 5
	attribute method = mc
}

attribute t.weight = "0.1"
```
